h2. PBKDF2 for Java

This is a fork and *unofficial* repository of the PBKDF2 library from http://www.rtner.de/software/PBKDF2.html. The differences of this fork are:

* Build tool switches from ant to mvn for simple dependency management.
* Source controlled with git.

Since this is an unofficial repository, I make no promise of keeping it up-to-date. Use this repository at your own risk.
